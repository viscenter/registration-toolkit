2D Registration Feature/Improvements and Problems

1. DPI issue
    ~Registration gives an error (images not in same physical space) and is fixed by 
        changing the DPI with imagemagick or photoshop 
    ~Not sure what the underlying issue is 
    
2. Alpha layer
    ~Program does not support an alpha channel 

3. RBG Color
    ~Gray scale images are not supported by autopano (not a valid image)
    
4. CSV issues
    ~CSV files can not have blank lines and there has to be spaces after the 
        commas 
    ~Can not edit CSV files in Excel (can use textedit) 
        
5. Possible improvements
    ~Add external prompt to determine number of pixels checked in registration 
        and number of iterations
